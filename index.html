            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <p>I'm Josh. I'm a first year MS student in UW's HCDE program. My background is in graphic design. Before moving to Seattle, I was working in government doing all kinds of print/digital/web design type things.  I've done some HTML/CSS and a smattering of Javascript, though probably not enough to be useful. I've never taken any type of coding/programming class before, so I'm really excited to get going. I don't intend to become a super-programmer, but eventually I would like to be proficient enough to understand what happens on the development side.  A conversational programmer, perhaps.</p>
            <p>End.</p>
